        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this exercise is to provide a quick check on a couple of the technical skills you'll need in Machine Learning for Public Policy Lab (94-889) anbd help us make sure everyone coming in has the necessary pre-requisites including python, data analysis, databases/sql, and machine learning. \n",
        "\n",
        "Feel free to use any references (previous class notes, google, stackoverflow, etc) you would like, but please complete the exercise on your own to ensure the work reflects your experience. **Completing this notebook should take you under 2 hours** -- if you're finding you need to take significantly more time on, you may find it difficult to contribute to the project work in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Problem Background\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook makes use of a sample of the data provided by [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) to the [2014 KDD Cup](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data). Public schools in the United States face large disparities in funding, often resulting in teachers and staff members filling these gaps by purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pockets. DonorsChoose is an online crowdfunding platform that tries to help alleviate this financial burden on teachers by allowing them to seek funding for projects and resources from the community (projects can include classroom basics like books and markers, larger items like lab equipment or musical instruments, specific experiences like field trips or guest speakers). Projects on DonorsChoose expire after 4 months, and if the target funding level isn't reached, the project receives no funding. Since its launch in 2000, the platform has helped fund over 2 million projects at schools across the US, but about 1/3 of the projects that are posted nevertheless fail to meet their goal and go unfunded.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Modeling Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purposes of this exercise, we'll imagine that DonorsChoose has hired a digital content expert who will review projects and help teachers improve their postings and increase their chances of reaching their funding threshold. Because this individualized review is a labor-intensive process, the digital content expert has time to review and support only 10% of the projects posted to the platform on a given day. \n",
        "\n",
        "You are a data scientist working with DonorsChoose, and your task is to help this content expert focus their limited resources on projects that most need the help. As such, you want to build a model to identify projects that are least likely to be fully funded before they expire and pass them off to the digital content expert for review.\n"

The line for random forest models bend towards the ideal classifier across almost all threshold levels. This means that the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity is best for the model, among those we have compared. To get a higher true positive rate, you have to endure fewer false positives for this model as compared to others."

        "The results show that for the best model evaluated, the top 10% of projects most likely to fail were $200 more expensive on average: they had an average ask of \\$786 as compared to an average ask of \\$559 for projects that were not selected for prioritization. This may have something to do with the fact that the highest risk projects are also most likely to request technology resources, which can be costly. Roughly 50% of the highest risk projects were for technology resources as compared to 31% for the rest of the projects. The model, though correct 72% of the time overall, has a long way to go before it will be ready for deployment. There were 627 projects which were falsely predicted to receive full funding even though they failed, and only 308 projects which were correctly predicted as **not** receiving full funding. Initial impressions suggest that the model responds well to high-cost projects asking for expensive technology (an obvious finding), but overall is failing to capture the whole picture. The next step should be to evaluate these cases where the model incorrectly predicts that a project will succeed."
